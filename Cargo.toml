# `bundled` causes us to automatically compile and link in an up to date
# version of SQLite for you. This avoids many common build issues, and
# avoids depending on the version of SQLite on the users system (or your
# system), which may be old or missing. It's the right choice for most
# programs that control their own SQLite databases.
